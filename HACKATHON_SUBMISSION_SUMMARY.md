# üöÄ Aleph Hackathon 2025 - Final Submission Summary

## üéØ **Project: TimeFlowVault**

**BUIDL Project Name:** TimeFlowVault  
**Category:** DeFi + Consumer Applications  
**Track:** Lisk Track  
**AI Agent:** No  

---

## üìù **Vision & Problem Statement**

### **Problem:**
Traditional financial systems operate on lump-sum payments, creating critical issues:
- **Cash Flow Problems**: Businesses and individuals receive money in chunks, leading to uneven cash flow
- **Inefficient Subscriptions**: Fixed monthly/yearly payments don't reflect actual service usage
- **Payroll Inefficiencies**: Employees wait for payday instead of accessing earned wages in real-time
- **Vendor Payment Delays**: Suppliers face payment delays affecting their operations

### **Solution:**
TimeFlowVault introduces a revolutionary hybrid protocol that combines:
1. **Real-Time Money Streaming**: Enables continuous, per-second fund distribution
2. **Sustainable DeFi Vault**: Provides staking rewards funded by actual streaming fees
3. **Blockchain Transparency**: Ensures trustless, verifiable payment streams

### **Innovation:**
- **First Hybrid Protocol**: Combines money streaming with DeFi staking in a single contract
- **Sustainable Rewards**: Rewards are funded by actual usage (streaming fees), not infinite printing
- **Real-Time Calculations**: Both streaming and rewards update per-second for maximum efficiency
- **Fee-Based Revenue Model**: 0.1% streaming fee creates sustainable economic ecosystem

## üé• **Demo Video Script (3 Minutes)**

### **Opening (0:00-0:15)**
"Hi, I'm [Your Name] and I'm presenting TimeFlowVault - a revolutionary hybrid protocol that combines real-time money streaming with sustainable DeFi staking, built on Lisk blockchain."

### **Problem Statement (0:15-0:30)**
"Traditional payments are lump-sum transactions. Whether it's payroll, subscriptions, or vendor payments, money moves in chunks rather than flowing continuously. This creates cash flow problems and inefficient payment systems."

### **Solution Overview (0:30-0:45)**
"TimeFlowVault solves this by enabling real-time money streaming where funds flow per-second, combined with a DeFi vault where users can stake ETH and earn rewards from streaming fees."

### **Live Demo - Streaming (0:45-1:30)**
"Let me show you how it works. First, I'll create a money stream. I enter the recipient address, amount of 0.01 ETH, and duration of 1 hour. The system calculates a 0.1% fee and creates a stream that flows at 0.00000277 ETH per second. Now I'll show you the recipient can withdraw available funds in real-time. As time passes, more funds become available for withdrawal."

### **Live Demo - Staking (1:30-2:00)**
"Next, let's look at the staking interface. Users can stake ETH to earn rewards. The rewards are funded by actual streaming fees, ensuring sustainability. I'll stake 0.01 ETH and show you how rewards accumulate over time."

### **Lisk Integration (2:00-2:30)**
"TimeFlowVault is fully deployed on Lisk blockchain. Here's our verified contract on Lisk Sepolia testnet. The contract address is 0x0087b73fFe05A8e1fcFE4406dc90Ff062c755519, and you can see all transactions on the Lisk explorer."

### **Closing (2:30-3:00)**
"TimeFlowVault represents the future of DeFi - combining practical money streaming with sustainable rewards. Built on Lisk for scalability and real-world adoption, this protocol solves genuine business problems while advancing blockchain technology. Thank you!"
